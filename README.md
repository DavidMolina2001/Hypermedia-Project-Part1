      Target user profile
      -------------------
            The target user for this website is anyone who wants to hire me for work.
            As it is a website CV and not the typical pdf, it is more likely to be oriented to a computer engineer type of work but it could be any type of contractor.
            He/she is expected to find my abilities and experience aswell as my languages and a little bit of description about me.
      
      Information architecture
      ------------------------
            The website is mainly divided in two parts distinguished by the two main colours, blue and white.
            At the left hand side we have my photo and my name aswell as some quick contact information, education and languages.
            At the right hand side we have some description, experience and skills.
            
      Visual design
      -------------
            The color palette will be blueish i think this color gives great readability and contrast between the two main parts.
            For the typography I've decided to use the Verdana family as it rounds more letters and doesn't feel very squared and orthopedic.
            As I've said in the other paragraph, the website is mainly divided in two parts, this has been inspired by many CV that I saw online that used the same layout.
            
Here is the design proposal using Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/Dyt2t37neuoFI8V7SmwI6z/HyperMedia-Project-Part1?node-id=1%3A2.
            
            I've added it as PDF aswell.
            
            And finally here's the website url: https://davidmolina2001.github.io/Hypermedia-Project-Part1/ .
